# Does invasive monitoring of ICP in severe TBI patients improve outcome?
 
## Are increases in ICP specifically associated with bad outcomes, or just correlated with other processes?
[Marmarou, et al (1991)](https://thejns.org/view/journals/j-neurosurg/75/Supplement/article-pS59.xml) did a review of 428 patients in a TBI database, and performed a logistic regression of multiple potential factors contributing to outcome in severe TBI. The statistical methods were designed to exclude overlapping causes. Outcome was defined using the Glascow Outcome Score (GOS). Independently significant factors included:
* Age
* GCS motor score (on admission)
* Abnormal pupil response
* Proportion of time with SBP <80
* **Proportion of time with ICP > 20**
 
They concluded that **increased ICP is an independent predictor of poor outcome in TBI**, even after controlling for other potential signs.
 
## After introducing ICP monitoring, have outcomes improved?
[Stein, et al (2010)](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/neu.2009.1206) did a review of 150 years of published outcomes of TBIs and found a dramatic decrease over the years in mortality. Over the period studied (from 1885 to 2006), mortality dropped from around 65% to 35%. Interestingly, there were two distinct phases: **after 1970 mortality initially dropped dramatically (from 50% to 35%)**, then after 1990 mortality remained the same.
 
**ICP monitoring came into clinical use starting around 1970**, which suggests this may have contributed to the decline. However, several other technologies and techniques were introduced at the same time, which confound our ability to draw strong conclusions. For example, CT imaging and advanced ICU care was also introduced at this time. Hypothermia, steroids, and intentional hypovolemia/hypotension was also routinely practiced. Improvements in these areas may explain the reduction in mortality as well as ICP monitoring.
 
## The introduction of ICP has been temporally correlated with improvements in outcomes, but what about comparing outcomes at similar modern hospitals?
Given that many clinicians continued to feel strongly both for and against the utility of ICP monitoring, [Cremer, et al (2005)](https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/fulltext/2005/10000/Effect_of_intracranial_pressure_monitoring_and.9.aspx) looked at outcomes in two similar regional hospitals that did or did not use ICP monitoring routinely. Although this was not randomized, the only factor that determined hospital assignment was geographic location.
 
Analyzing 940 patients, **they found no significant difference in favorable outcomes (GOS) when using ICP monitoring**. This suggests that although the introduction of ICP may have been associated with a reduction in mortality, the actual cause may have been secondary to factors other than routine ICP monitoring. Even though increased ICP is linked with worse outcomes, close monitoring of ICP may not help more than routine neuro-ICU care.
 
## Are there any randomized trials supporting ICP monitoring in TBI?
This controversy of the utility of ICP monitoring prompted **two RCTs of ICP monitoring**. The first was a small trial consisting of 61 patients [(Kostic, 2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22097111). They failed to show any significant differences between patients randomized to ICP monitoring versus clinical exam. A second, larger RCT consisted of 324 patients [(BEST TRIP; Chestnut, 2012)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1207363), which again **failed to show any differences in mortality or functional status after 6 months**.
 
In a well written editorial published after the BEST TRIP trial, [Chestnut (2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00134-013-2852-9) clarifies that the trial was not meant to minimize the relationship between increased ICP and poor outcomes, or that uncontrolled ICP frequently leads to death. In the non-ICP monitored group, ICP treatments were still administered (e.g., hyperosmolar therapies and decompressive surgery), but were indicated by clinical exam, vital signs, and CT scans. The trial specifically suggests that **invasive ICP monitoring does not offer any additional information beyond clinical exam and CT that affect outcome**.
 
## Is there any evidence supporting the use of routine ICP monitoring in TBI?
A recent meta-analysis of 18 studies [(Shen, et al, 2016)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168901) looked at the studies to date on whether ICP monitoring is associated with improvements in outcome. Across all of the studies, they did not find any difference, but **restricting the analysis to observational studies after 2007, they were able to demonstrate a decrease in mortality**.
 
A representative recent study is [Agrawal, et al (2015)](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/neu.2015.4015). They looked at 1345 patients in a trauma registry and compared outcomes between patients where ICP monitoring was chosen versus those where it was deferred. After attempted to statistically equate the groups as much as possible, **they showed a 7.3% decrease in 6-month mortality**, with no difference in functional outcome.
 
However, given it is an observational study, it begs the question: _why did the clinician decide to monitor some patients and not others?_ Where there clinical factors (not already accounted for) that suggested the ICP monitored patients might be “salvageable” whereas the patients that were not monitored were thought to be less likely to?
 
## Conclusions?
Since increased ICP is strongly associated with poor outcome, it is intuitive that aggressively managing ICP in TBI patients _should_ improve outcome. However, the two RCTs and the majority of observational studies have failed to show any benefit of using invasive ICP monitors. Recent observational studies do support their use, but is this a spurious correlation?
 
Routine use of ICP monitors is still the standard of care, and still the recommendation of the Brain Trauma Foundation (although tempered by the suggestion that evidence supporting their use is poor). Is routine use of invasive ICP monitoring still advisable? Do we need more studies? Will future advances in ICP monitoring or management increase the impact of these monitors?
