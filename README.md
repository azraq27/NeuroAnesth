# Topics in Neuroanesthesia

This is a small website for me to organize material relating to neuroanesthesia. I'm starting this project as part of my fellowship training, and I'm hoping that the information will be useful to others in the field.

## Topical Reviews

These are reviews of the evidence behind current issues or practices within neuroanesthesia. They are meant to contain concise reviews of the literature supporting the current practice, along with commentary from expert opinion about the relevance of the hard data to everyday practice.
