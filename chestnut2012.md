_AKA: The BEST-TRIP trial_

### Key points:
* Largest RCT testing impact of ICP monitoring
* Randomized 324 patients in South American ICUs to an ICP-based protocol, or neuro exam / CT protocol
* Found *no difference* in 6-month mortality, functional status, or complication rates

### Summary:

Very well done trial. Given that ICP monitoring is considered standard of care in the US, an RCT would not be ethical. Performing this trial in South America, where routine ICP monitoring is not fully accepted, created a unique opportunity to conduct a fully randomized trial under ethical conditions.

Patients included in this trial were severe TBI patients (GCS 3-8 immediately, or within 48hrs of admission), who were not deemed "unsurviveable." All patients were randomized to CT or ICP groups.

The CT group had regular head CTs performed at presentation, 48hrs, and 5-7 days post-injury, along with standard ICU care based on clinical assessment.

The ICP group had an intraparenchymal pressure monitor or ventricular drain placed immediately. Elevated ICP (>20mmHg) was treated with a standard algorithm.

At 6-months, the ICP group had 39% mortality, while the CT group had 41% (_p_ = 0.60). Favorable outcomes (based on Glascow Outcome Scale) were 44% in the ICP group, and 39% in the CT group.

### Conclusions: 

Using a TBI management protocol consisting of only neuro exams and CT scans did not result in significantly different patient outcomes.

This does not mean that ICP is not meaningful, or that treating ICP does not help. This trial specifically addressed whether continuous ICP monitoring gives the clinician additional information (above what's available from clinical assessment and CT) that will improve outcome. 

Overall, it did not appear that invasive monitoring of ICP provided new information in patients with severe TBI. There may still be certain sub-populations where patients would benefit from close ICP monitoring. Changes in ICP monitors or newer ICP interventions may also provide benefits.
