## Does aggressively managing ICP improve outcomes in severe TBI?

We frequently monitor intracranial pressure (ICP) using invasive devices in TBI patients, and manage patients to optimize ICP and CPP. But...

_does managing ICP actually matter?_

This brief review will cover the literature regarding whether we should monitor ICP, and if it changes patient outcomes.

### Does increased ICP correlate with outcomes?

There is a proponderance of data, and empirical clinical experience that shows that increased ICP correlates with severe neurologic damage, and that uncontrolled elevations in ICP will proceed to additional cerebral insults (secondary damage, due to herniation or stroke).

### Does monitoring ICP improve outcomes?

Given the importance of ICP in the etiology of secondary damage after TBI, invasive monitoring of ICP has become standard clinical practice. Although it is clear that uncontrolled elevated ICP is harmful to patients, it is not so clear that aggressively monitoring and treating elevations in ICP will actually improve outcome. Because of the critical nature of these patients, it has also been difficult to do experimental trials under ethical circumstances.

The largest randomized controlled trial testing ICP monitoring in severe TBI was [Chestnut, 2012](chestnut2012.md)

### Is an ICP < 20mmHg a good goal?
